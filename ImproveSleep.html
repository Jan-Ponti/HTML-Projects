                <h2> Why is sleep important? </h2>

                <p>
                Getting good quality sleep is as important as regular exercise and a healthy diet. Research shows that poor sleep has immediate negative effects on
                your hormones, exercise performance, and brain function. In contrast, good sleep can help you eat less, exercise better, and be healthier. Over the past few
                decades, both sleep quality and quantity have declined. In fact, many people regularly get poor sleep. If you want to optimize your health or lose weight, getting
                a good night's sleep is one of the most important things you can do.

                <h3> Increase bright light exposure during the day </h3>

                <p> Your body has a natural time-keeping clock known as your circadian rhythm.
                It affects your brain, body, and hormones, helping you stay awake and telling your body when it’s time to sleep.
                Natural sunlight or bright light during the day helps keep your circadian rhythm healthy. This improves daytime energy, as well as nighttime sleep quality and duration.
                In people with insomnia, daytime bright light exposure improved sleep quality and duration. It also reduced the time it took to fall asleep by 83%.
                A similar study in older adults found that 2 hours of bright light exposure during the day increased the amount of sleep by 2 hours and sleep efficiency by 80% .
                While most research involves people with severe sleep issues, daily light exposure will most likely help you even if you experience average sleep.
                Try getting daily sunlight exposure or — if this is not practical — invest in an artificial bright light device or bulbs.
                </p>

                <h3> Reduce blue light exposure in the evening </h3>

                <p> Exposure to light during the day is beneficial, but nighttime light exposure has the opposite effect.
                Again, this is due to its effect on your circadian rhythym, tricking your brain into thinking it's still daytime. This reduced hormones like melatonin,
                which help you relax and get deep sleep. Blue light - which electronic devices like smartphones and computers emit in large amounts - this is the worst in regard.
                There are several popular methods you can use to reduce nighttime blue light exposure. These include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Wear glasses that block blue light </li>
                    <li>Download an app to block blue light on your laptop or computer</li>
                    <li>Install an app that blocks blue light on your smartphone. These are available to both iPhones and and Android devices</li>
                    <li>Stop watching TV and turn off any bright lights 2 hours before heading to bed</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <h3> Stop consuming caffeine late in the day </h3>

                <p> Caffeine has numerous benefits and is consumed by 90% of the US population. A single dose can enhance focus, energy, and sports performance.
                However, when consumed late in the day, caffeine stimulates your nervous system and may stop your body from naturally relaxing at night. In one study,
                consuming caffeine up to 6 hours before bed significantly worsened sleep quality. Caffeine can stay elevated in your blood for 6-8 hours. Therefore, drinking
                large amounts of coffee after 3-4pm is not recommended, especially if you're sensitive to caffeine or have trouble sleeping. If you do crave a cup of coffee in
                the late afternoon or evening, stick with decaffeinated coffee.                
                </p>

                <h3> Reduce irregular or long daytime naps </h3>

                <p> While short power naps are beneficial, long or irregular napping during the day can negatively affect your sleep.
                Sleeping in the daytime can confuse your internal clock, meaning that you may struggle to sleep at night.
                In fact, in one study, participants ended up being sleepier during the day after taking daytime naps.
                Another study noted that while napping for 30 minutes or less can enhance daytime brain function, longer naps can harm health and sleep quality.
                However, some studies demonstrate that those who are used to taking regular daytime naps don’t experience poor sleep quality or disrupted sleep at night.
                If you take regular daytime naps and sleep well, you shouldn’t worry. The effects of napping depend on the individual.
                </p>

                <h3> Try to sleep and wake up at consistent times </h3>

                <p> Your body’s circadian rhythm functions on a set loop, aligning itself with sunrise and sunset.
                Being consistent with your sleep and waking times can aid long-term sleep quality.
                One study noted that participants who had irregular sleeping patterns and went to bed late on the weekends reported poor sleep.
                Other studies have highlighted that irregular sleep patterns can alter your circadian rhythm and levels of melatonin, which signal your brain to sleep.
                If you struggle with sleep, try to get in the habit of waking up and going to bed at similar times. After several weeks, you may not even need an alarm.
